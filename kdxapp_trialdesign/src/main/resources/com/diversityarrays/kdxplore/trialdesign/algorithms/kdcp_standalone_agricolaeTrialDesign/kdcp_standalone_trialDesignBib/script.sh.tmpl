# CAUTION: DO NOT DELETE ANY VARIABLES BELOW, EVEN IF NOT USED BY YOUR ALGORITHM
# Below are variables provided by KDCompute need to find relevant items
#
CLASSNAME='<%= className %>'
WHEN='<%= when %>'
ALGORITHMNAME='<%= algorithmName %>'
VERSIONSTRING='<%= versionString %>'
VERSIONCODE='<%= versionCode %>'
ALGORITHMDIR='<%= algorithmDir %>'
JOBDIR='<%= jobDir %>'

# CAUTION: Modifying the next section can cause Plugin execution and KDCPluginStudio loading errors.
#  It is safer to make required changes within KDCPluginStudio 
#  If you want to risk it, you can add args below, as long as they match those in your Specification (plugin.json) file
#
TREATMENTFILE='<%= treatmentfile %>'
NUMROWS='<%= NUMROWS %>'
NUMCOLS='<%= NUMCOLS %>'
SIZEOFBLOCK='<%= SIZEOFBLOCK %>'
RNS='<%= rns %>'

# AUTOGENERATED_BY_KDCPLUGINSTUDIO
# NOTE: The following can be modified without risking loading this script in KDCPluginStudio.
#  However the logic below still needs to work, along with subroutine call made for the plugin to execute correctly.
#
#Use an array to seperate segmenets of the command. This avoids errors that could occur due to spaces in filepaths
# Always provide a fullpath to any algorithm binaries, located by the variable ALGORITHMDIR
# Any commands, such as that below, is executed from JOBDIR. You don't need to ensure outputed files are prefixed
Rscript $ALGORITHMDIR/trial_design.R --treatmentfile $TREATMENTFILE --outputdir ./ --rns $RNS --numrows $NUMROWS --numcols $NUMCOLS --sizeofblock $SIZEOFBLOCK
